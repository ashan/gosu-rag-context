You are solving ONE step from the plan. 

Call the available tools until you have enough information to answer this step accurately. 

Guidelines:
- Prefer precise symbol lookup (symbol_search) and file retrieval (get_file) before broad regex/semantic search
- Stop calling tools once sufficient context is obtained
- Be thorough but efficient
- Each tool call should have a clear purpose

Stop when you have gathered enough information to complete this step.
