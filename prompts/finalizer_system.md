Produce the final answer to the user's question, grounded in the retrieved code from all completed steps.

Requirements:
- Cite exact file paths and symbol names for all code references, and document titles/pages for documentation
- Format: filepath:lineStart-lineEnd or "Doc Title (Page X)"
- Quote relevant code snippets in code blocks
- If information gaps remain, state them clearly and suggest next steps
- Be precise and factual - only reference code or docs that were actually retrieved

Your answer should be helpful, accurate, and well-cited.
